## 📊 Data Flow

1. User inputs search criteria
2. Application queries all 4 job sites simultaneously
3. Results are standardized and saved in the background
4. Filtered results are immediately displayed to the user
5. As background saves complete, more results become available

## 🎨 User Interface Considerations

- Implement infinite scrolling for job listings
- Provide clear visual indicators for new vs. viewed job listings
- Include filters for refining search results
- Implement a "save for later" feature for interesting job listings

## 🔒 Security Considerations

- Implement rate limiting for API requests
- Ensure proper authentication for user-specific actions (e.g., saving jobs, viewing application history)
- Sanitize and validate all user inputs to prevent injection attacks

## 🔜 Future Enhancements

- Implement machine learning for job recommendations based on user behavior
- Integrate with professional networking sites for additional job insights
- Develop a mobile app for on-the-go job searching
